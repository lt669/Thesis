abstract = {A system is described which is capable of presenting complex auditory environments to listeners in a perceptually plausible way, such that the listeners feel actually present in them. The listeners can move around in the presented environment and interact with it, e.g., by hand-movements. The virtual environment may encompass multiple direct and reflected sounds from spatially nonstationary sources, their actual number being only limited by current hardware restrictions. The setting of the sound paths (direct and reflected) can be cast after real acoustic scenarios or in any other reasonable way. Consequently, the system forms a flexible tool for psychoacoustic experimentation - among other applications. The system architecture has been designed in such a way that perceptual representation of other modalities (e.g., visual, tactile/thermal) can easily be incorporated. In fact, it represents the kernel of a multimodal virtual-reality generator. In psychoacoustic research this feature allows for providing feedback to non-auditory modalities.},

abstract = {A commonly accepted physiological model for lateralization of low-frequency$\backslash$nsounds by interaural time delay (ITD) stipulates that binaural comparison$\backslash$nneurons receive input from frequency-matched channels from each ear.$\backslash$nHere, the effects of hypothetical interaural frequency mismatches$\backslash$non this model are reported. For this study, the cat's auditory system$\backslash$nperipheral to the binaural comparison neurons was represented by$\backslash$na neurophysiologically derived model, and binaural comparison neurons$\backslash$nwere represented by cross-correlators. The results of the study indicate$\backslash$nthat, for binaural comparison neurons receiving input from one cochlear$\backslash$nchannel from each ear, interaural CF mismatches may serve to either$\backslash$naugment or diminish the effective difference in ipsilateral and contralateral$\backslash$naxonal time delays from the periphery to the binaural comparison$\backslash$nneuron. The magnitude of this increase or decrease in the effective$\backslash$ntime delay difference can be up to 400 microseconds for CF mismatches$\backslash$nof 0.2 octaves or less for binaural neurons with CFs between 250$\backslash$nHz and 2.5 kHz. For binaural comparison neurons with nominal CFs$\backslash$nnear 500 Hz, the 25-microsecond effective time delay difference caused$\backslash$nby a 0.012-octave CF mismatch is equal to the ITD previously shown$\backslash$nto be behaviorally sufficient for the cat to lateralize a low-frequency$\backslash$nsound source.},

abstract = {This paper describes a method for evaluating the acoustics of concert halls, prior to construction, by simulating the sound transmission in the hall on a digital computer. A reverberation-free sound signal is sampled, quantized and fed into the computer. The computer adds echoes and reverberation to this signal and produces two output signals. These signals, when radiated from two loudspeakers in an anechoic chamber, combine at the ears of a centrally seated listener to form echo responses similar to those in the real hall. The computer program allows the specification of the individual discrete echoes in amplitude, delay and direction of incidence. The continuous reverberation is simulated with adjustable frequency-dependent reverberation time, shape of decay curve, diffusion, echo density and frequency response irregularity.

abstract = {Aiming at the perceptual evaluation of virtual acoustic environments (VAEs), ‘plausibility’ is introduced as a quality criterion that can be of value for many applications in virtual acoustics. We suggest a definition as well as an experimental operationalization for plausibility,referring to the perceivedagreement with the listener’s expectation towards acorresponding real acoustic event. The measurement model includes the criterion-free assessment of the deviation from this non-explicit, inner reference by rating corresponding real and simulated stimuli in a Yes/No test paradigm and analyzing the results according to signal detection theory.The specification of amin- imum effect hypothesis allows testing of plausibility with anydesired strictness. The approach is demonstrated with the perceptual evaluation of asystem for dynamic binaural synthesis in twodifferent development stages.},

@article{McAnally2014,
abstract = {Previous studies have shown that the accuracy of sound localization is improved if listeners are allowed to move their heads during signal presentation. This study describes the function relating localization accuracy to the extent of head movement in azimuth. Sounds that are difficult to localize were presented in the free field from sources at a wide range of azimuths and elevations. Sounds remained active until the participants' heads had rotated through windows ranging in width of 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, or 64° of azimuth. Error in determining sound-source elevation and the rate of front/back confusion were found to decrease with increases in azimuth window width. Error in determining sound-source lateral angle was not found to vary with azimuth window width. Implications for 3-d audio displays: the utility of a 3-d audio display for imparting spatial information is likely to be improved if operators are able to move their heads during signal presentation. Head movement may compensate in part for a paucity of spectral cues to sound-source location resulting from limitations in either the audio signals presented or the directional filters (i.e., head-related transfer functions) used to generate a display. However, head movements of a moderate size (i.e., through around 32° of azimuth) may be required to ensure that spatial information is conveyed with high accuracy.},

Although its behavior has been studied extensively in natural systems, it remains an untapped resource for computer-based systems. We investigate the possibility of using ILD for acoustic localization, deriving constraints on the location of a sound source given the relative energy level of the signals received by two microphones. We then present an algorithm for computing the sound source location by combining likelihood functions, one for each microphone pair. Experimental results show that accurate acoustic localization can be achieved using ILD alone.},

HRTFs are formally defined, and are shown to be important in reducing the ambiguity with which the classical duplex theory decodes a free-field sound's spatial location. Typical HRTF measurement strategies are described, and simple applications of HRTFs to headphone-based spatialized sound synthesis are given. By comparing and contrasting representations of HRTFs in the time, frequency, and spatial domains, different analytic and signal processing techniques used to investigate the structure of HRTFs are highlighted.},
