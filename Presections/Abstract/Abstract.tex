		 The project described in this document builds upon the Virtual Singing Studio, a loudspeaker based room acoustic simulation system, by extending its functionality to allow a user to move themselves around a virtual space through the use of a large grid of synthetically produced room impulse responses. The process of implementing said system was assessed and its plausibility investigated. Though the system in place provides a framework to build upon, it was found that for a real time application, the system in question encounters too many technical difficulties to be considered accurate or a beneficial tool.

		 % Though technical difficulties prevented the thorough investigation of the plausibility of the originally designed system, results were obtained 

		 % Though results indicate that a the grid of RIRs used should be separated by a distance of 3m for the system in question, further work is required in before a definitive judgement can be made on the plausibility of a system such as the one implemented.
		 %Though results regarding the plausibility of the implemented system were obtained, it was found that due to inaccuracies in both the system and the impulse responses used, improvements upon the system are required before more definitive judgement on the plausibility of the methods used in implementing the system can be made.

		 % It was found that an distance of 3m between impulse response locations for the implemented system was optimal, however improvement to the system are required before the  A system was produced to accommodate such functionality and the minimum number of impulse responses required for the system to . Though the system implemented provided the functionality intended,  It was found that the system that had been implemented 

		%. The direct room impulse response rendering method was chosen, where a large number of room impulse responses are produced in a grid in an attempt to provide an accurate approximation of the room acoustics for any location within the room by interpolation between a number of RIRs. During the implementation of such a system it was found to be too computationally expensive, thus a compromise was found.
