\section{Background}

	The following section provides a background on virtual acoustic environments and their application in this project as well as other projects where they have been utilised...

\subsection{Virtual Acoustic Environments}

	A \ac{VAE} has been previously described \cite{SalvadorCesar2010} as follows:

	\begin{center}
		\textit{``Virtual acoustic environments look to immerse a listener in an almost real acoustic environment, synthesizing wave fronts with physical methods and rendering them through loudspeaker arrays''}
	\end{center}




\subsubsection{Real RIRs}

\subsubsection{Synthetic RIRs}

\paragraph{Geometrical Methods}

This is a method
