	%Despite attempts to make SRIR accurate they still do not sound close enough

	%It is still apparent that they are convincing enough

	%Compare against initial project metrics

	%Due to computer speed not being able to run the desired system (Iteration 1) a compramise had to be found. As a result of this, the system was much less accurate than intented, this may be a cause for some weird results and also defeats the purpose of using this system over the parametric rendering method

	\subsection{Project Summary}


	\subsection{Metrics Review}

	%Allow the user to freely move themselves around the VAE
	Due to the fact that iteration 1 and 2 failed, the fact is that technically the user could not move themselves freely, but rather move themselves to the closest possible \ac{RIR}.
