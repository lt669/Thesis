@article{Stan2002,
abstract = {The impulse response of an acoustical space or transducer is one of its most important characterizations. In order to perform the measurement of their impulse responses, four of the most suitable methods are compared: MLS (maximum-length sequence), IRS (inverse repeated sequence), time-stretched pulses, and SineSweep. These methods have already been described in the literature. Nevertheless, the choice of one of them depending on the measurement conditions is critical. Therefore an extensive comparison has been realized. This comparison was done through the implementation and realization of a complete, fast, reliable, and cheap measurement system. Finally, a conclusion for the use of each method according to the principal measurement conditions is presented. It is shown that in the presence of nonwhite noise, the MLS and IRS techniques seem to be more accurate. On the contrary, in quiet environments the logarithmic SineSweep method seems to be the most appropriate.},
