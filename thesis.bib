@article{Stan2002,
abstract = {The impulse response of an acoustical space or transducer is one of its most important characterizations. In order to perform the measurement of their impulse responses, four of the most suitable methods are compared: MLS (maximum-length sequence), IRS (inverse repeated sequence), time-stretched pulses, and SineSweep. These methods have already been described in the literature. Nevertheless, the choice of one of them depending on the measurement conditions is critical. Therefore an extensive comparison has been realized. This comparison was done through the implementation and realization of a complete, fast, reliable, and cheap measurement system. Finally, a conclusion for the use of each method according to the principal measurement conditions is presented. It is shown that in the presence of nonwhite noise, the MLS and IRS techniques seem to be more accurate. On the contrary, in quiet environments the logarithmic SineSweep method seems to be the most appropriate.},

@article{Southern,
abstract = {The synthesis of an arbitrary enclosures room impulse response (RIR) may be performed using acoustic modelling. A number of acoustic modelling methods have been proposed previously each with their own advantages and limitations. This paper is concerned with mixing the RIRs from different modelling methods to synthesize a hybrid RIR. Low frequencies are modelled using the finite difference time domain method (FDTD), high frequencies are treated with geometric methods. A practical implementation for forming a hybrid RIR is discussed and further demonstrated in the context of a 2nd order B-Format spatial encode of the modelled sound field. The paper discusses the considerations and limitations of forming such hybrid RIRs using wave-based and geometric-based methods.},

%-------------Direct Sound papers-------------%
@article{Devore2009,
abstract = {In reverberant environments, acoustic reflections interfere with the direct sound arriving at a listener's ears, distorting the spatial cues for sound localization. Yet, human listeners have little difficulty localizing sounds in most settings. Because reverberant energy builds up over time, the source location is represented relatively faithfully during the early portion of a sound, but this representation becomes increasingly degraded later in the stimulus. We show that the directional sensitivity of single neurons in the auditory midbrain of anesthetized cats follows a similar time course, although onset dominance in temporal response patterns results in more robust directional sensitivity than expected, suggesting a simple mechanism for improving directional sensitivity in reverberation. In parallel behavioral experiments, we demonstrate that human lateralization judgments are consistent with predictions from a population rate model decoding the observed midbrain responses, suggesting a subcortical origin for robust sound localization in reverberant environments. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

@article{Smith2003,
abstract = {Convolution Convolution is a mathematical way of combining two signals to form a third signal. It is the single most important technique in Digital Signal Processing. Using the strategy of impulse decomposition, systems are described by a signal called the impulse response. Convolution is important because it relates the three signals of interest: the input signal, the output signal, and the impulse response. This chapter presents convolution from two different viewpoints, called the input side algorithm and the output side algorithm. Convolution provides the mathematical framework for DSP; there is nothing more important in this book.},
